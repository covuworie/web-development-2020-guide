# Web Development In 2020 - A Practical Guide Video Tutorials List
Web development is a minefield of tools and technologies and it is very difficult to know what you need to learn and why you need to learn it. The absolute best resource I have come across on this topic is the YouTube video [Web Development In 2020 - A Practical Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw) by [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/). Watching this video is an absolute must for anyone who wants to become a web developer. In fact before you start learning anything you should first watch this video to understand the big picture. It will act as an invaluable compass in your learning journey. Free Code Camp's blog post [Web Development in 2020: What Coding Tools You Should Learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-development-2020/) gives a good high-level summary of what is covered in the video should you wish to know more prior to investing your time in watching the video.

Brad mentions in the video that you **DO NOT** need to learn everything here. He is essentially providing you with an option menu of what you *CAN* learn (and some things you *SHOULD* learn - such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and why you should learn certain things depending on what your goals are. So really it is up to you to pick and choose from his menu what you want to learn.

I have created a list of links below to certain sections of the video along with the slides so you can delve further into certain specific topics that you are interested in learning more about. I have also added links to the suggested YouTube tutorials highlighted in the video. Also, I have added links to relevant sections of Andrew Shearer's excellent [Web Development 2020 Course List](https://github.com/andrews1022/web-development-2020-course-list) that comprises a list of the top Udemy courses for each slide as well as other resources. In fact this very repository is based on his excellent work. However, not everyone likes or can afford Udemy courses on all of these topics so I wanted to provide links to the YouTube videos so that people can either learn for free or in a more bitesized manner.

OK no time to waste and time to start learning cos it's gonna take you years to learn even part of this stuff! ðŸ˜Š

Wow, that is a **_LOT_** to learn! 2020 is looking to be an amazing time to learn about web development, and far more than that too. 

But wait, there's **MORE!!**

_gasps_

Udemy is also well known for having all-in-one full stack web development courses, as well as more recently full stack courses with specific technologies, such as MERN, MEAN, and recently MEVN. These 3 all use the same 3 letters: M, E, & N which stand for MongoDB, Express, and Node. The key difference between them is which JavaScript library/framework they use. MERN uses React, MEAN uses Angular, and MEVN uses Vue. You can find courses for these listed below.

Also below are courses for Data Structures & Algorithms, as well as interview prep. JavaScript interviews, especially at large companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, etc., are infamous for their whiteboard coding challenges. Below are some of the top courses for Data Structures & Algorithms for JavaScript to help you ace your next interview.

And finally, testing, or Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD is actually quite important, so knowing how to test your code will be huge boost to your resume/skill set and set you apart from other candidates when you start applying for jobs.
